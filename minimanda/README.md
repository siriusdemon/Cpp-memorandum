# Minimanda

Hi, this is an experimental programming language. I use the same basic structure of chibicc and commit style. You can follow the commit steps from [here](https://github.com/siriusdemon/memorandum/commit/cd9bef22b70be8be65a132bbdb51963cba445ce6)


Manda is designed as a Lisp-style C programming language. So you have already mastered it!
