# Minimanda

Hi, this is an experimental programming language. I use the same basic structure and commit style of chibicc. You can follow the commit steps from [here](https://github.com/siriusdemon/memorandum/commits/main/minimanda)

Manda is designed as a Lisp-style C programming language. So you have already mastered it!
